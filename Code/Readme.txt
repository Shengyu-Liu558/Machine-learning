How to run the code:

1. There are two files saved in ipynb format so that you 
   can run them on google colab or jyputer or the envirement 
   with Python3.6 or 3.7 version.
2. You don't need to load any datasets from outside.Just run 
   the function fashion_mnist.load_data() in the first part 
   of code in Assignment2_main_algorithm.It can be directly to load.

3. All kfold or cross validation process and result had been ran and done 
   in the Cross_validation file.You can check or see them the
   without run again because most of function will take long time run.

4. I implemented four methods (Knn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LinearSVC) in the
   Main_algorithm file.

5. Run the code in the main_algorithm file from top to buttom step by step.

6. If you run in the jupyter or python environment may be need install some package
   before run the code. using !pip install 'package name' if some error happend.
